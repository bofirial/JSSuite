100000	We've picked a Date!	2013-04-07	Jen and James	<p>We will be getting married on April 5th, 2014, exactly a year and a day after getting engaged. Why, you might ask? Well, the main reason is that's the amount of time that feels right to us. We had originally planned on having a shorter engagement, but there's a lot more planning involved with getting married than we expected, and we both have certain parts of the event we would like to have enough time to make ours. Another concern is we'd like to get married in the spring or summer to avoid bad weather since the majority of our guests will be travelling to our wedding. Spring and Summer happen to be "Wedding Season", which means we'll need plenty of time to make reservations. In addition, the more notice we give our guests, the more time they have to make arrangements to come to our wedding if they would like.</p><p>We already have a lot of things going on this summer on top of the wedding planning as well. James recently started a new job and Jen's project is going live to the public soon, so that's going to mean a lot of extra hours at work for the both of us. We're also working on developing a more active lifestyle and getting out of the house more - and working on the house too. We have a couple projects in our home that'd we'd really like to take on this summer.</p><p>We want the time to enjoy this process without feeling rushed. It means we have time to earn some vacation time, so that we can make the most out of this wonderful time in our lives. We also have more time to get our finances in order, so we can plan the event without having to make certain sacrifices.</p><p>So, long story short, April 5th, 2014 seems like the best date for us. We're really excited to be getting married in less than a year!	2014-05-06 20:14:08.173	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.173	3	0x00000000000007D1
100001	Engagement Photos!	2013-04-25	Jen and James	<p>James found an amazing deal on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jcpportraits.com/">JC Penney Portraits</a> photo sessions, so today we dressed up nice and went in and had engagement photos taken. It was a lot of fun and the majority of them turned out great!</p><p>We decided to purchase a media package so we'll be able to use the images from the session on this website, Facebook and our Save the Dates.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.200	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.200	3	0x00000000000007D2
100002	Save The Date	2013-05-13	Jen and James	<p>Our first wedding purchase - we ordered our Save the Dates. We've been looking into them for a few weeks and finally found the site we wanted to order them from - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weddingpaperdivas.com/">Wedding Paper Divas</a>. They are a wedding themed site associated with the more well known stationary store - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a>. We actually found them thanks to Jen's sister Ally, who ordered us Address Labels in our wedding colors from Shutterfly.</p><p>We loved a lot of their designs and finally decided on a simple postcard with a teal band across it that showcases a photograph - which works great with the Engagement photos we recently received. It looks especially nice with the photo in black and white - which is great with our black/white/blue/green color scheme.</p><p>We also ordered wedding-themed <a target="_blank" href="https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?categoryNavIds=catBuyStamps&categoryNav=false&navAction=jump&navCount=0&productId=S_575904&categoryId=catBuyStamps">"White Rose" Stamps</a> for all of our invites, RSVP cards, and thank you cards in addition to the save the dates. Things are going great with the wedding planning so far as well!</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.207	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.207	3	0x00000000000007D3
100003	Engagement Party	2013-05-27	Jen and James	<p>This weekend, we had a barbeque get together so our families could finally get the chance to meet. It was a lot of fun getting to host the event in our home in Dayton, Ohio and celebrate our engagement with those closest to us. In attendance were Jen's parents from Xenia, Ohio, and her sister, Ally, was nice enough to fly in from San Diego, California. We were also very pleased to have James' parents, three brothers - Brandon, Justin, and Tyler, and Justin's fiancée Nicole join us from Portland, Michigan.</p><p>In addition to our immediate family members, we also had some of our closest friends there for the occasion, including the remaining members of the wedding party. Overall, the party was a huge success. We both had a blast and believe our friends and family did as well. This weekend was also a great opportunity for us to get to know each other's families. James, Brandon, and Tyler joined Jen and her family for a breakfast with her cousins who were in town. In addition, Jen had a lot of quality time with James' family when they went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/">Air Force Museum</a> (definitely worth a visit if you have some free time in the area) as well as back at our home visiting, playing games, and celebrating James' dad's birthday.  We're looking forward to the next major event in our wedding preparation journey - visiting and selecting the reception venue!</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.213	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.213	3	0x00000000000007D4
100004	The Good and The Bad	2013-05-30	Jen and James	<p>We got the church! It's official! We have a venue for our ceremony. We've been waiting about a month to hear back and last night we got the news that we are good to go. The church is the same place Jen's sister was married in, as well as our close friend Cheyenne. We're also excited to have Josh as our Officiant, he was confirmed to be in the ceremony a few weeks ago.</p><p>Not everything is going as planned though...</p><p>Our first big setback - our first choice reception venue (The Nutter Center) is already booked for April 5th next year. We hadn't had a chance to tour the space yet, but it had a lot of what we were looking for and the added bonus of being the convention center associated to Jen's Alma Mater.  We're not discouraged though, as far as hiccups go, this is a relatively small one and we have a fair list of other venues we are interested in. We're certain we will find the perfect location for our reception.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.220	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.220	3	0x00000000000007D5
100005	Reception Venue Time!	2013-06-04	Jen and James	<p>We have a couple wedding events booked and we're really excited! It's going to be a really busy week and a half.</p><ul><li>Thursday, June 6th, 5:00 PM: Venue: The Mandalay Banquet Center & Catering</li><li>Sunday, June 9th, 1:00 PM: Venue: The Deli and Top of the Market</li><li>Sunday, June 9th, 4:00 PM: Venue: Hilton Garden Inn Dayton/Beavercreek</li><li>Tuesday, June 11th, 6:00 PM: Venue: Newport Aquarium</li><li>Wednesday, June 12th, 5:00 PM: "Scan for a Grand" Gift Registry Event - Macy's</li><li>Friday, June 14th, 5:00 PM: Venue: Kohler Catering Presidential Banquet Center</li><li>Saturday, June 15th, 2:00 PM: Venue: Beavercreek Golf Club</li></ul>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.223	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.223	3	0x00000000000007D6
100006	The Mandalay Banquet Center & Catering	2013-06-06	Jen and James	<p>We went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mandalaycatering.com/">Mandalay</a> today, along with Jen's mom, and we were very pleased. The drive in left a little to be desired, but the front of the building was nice and the inside rooms were very impressive. From a budget perspective, this place is right where we want to be. They even have the added bonus of 80% of the money being due closer to the reception. While we're fine with a 50/50 split (what most places go with), having more money now for favors, clothes, the honeymoon, etc is a nice plus.</p><p>As far as the look of the reception space, it's probably a 'B' or 'C'. The floors and chairs are red, which doesn't quite mesh with our Black/White/Blue/Green color scheme. So, we'd definetely want to get chair covers, which aren't included in most packages. The walls are white with black frames, which look really nice and they have fairly nice chandeliers that would be over the dance floor.</p><p>One concern is that the ballroom is divided in 4ths and we would get 2 of those sections. That means the other half of the ballroom will very likely be rented out to another party. The event coordinator assured us that the events would be staggered if that were the case, but there would still be 2 parties sharing the restrooms and the possibility some noise disturbance.</p><p>All in all, it was an excellent first stop and we're really excited to check out the other venues.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.230	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.230	3	0x00000000000007D7
100007	Top of the Market Banquet & Events Center	2013-06-09	Jen and James	<p>This afternoon, we visited the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.topofmarket.com/">Top of the Market</a>. To quote James, it was more "The Middle of the Market". Overall, it was an alright venue. It's at the lower end of our expected budget and showed as much. It had a very interesting rustic look with exposed beams and brick, but the carpets have seen some age. With this space, we would be sharing the bathrooms with the other room in the space, but this venue does have the nice feature of the rooms being seperated by a floor and a central lobby. The Top of the Market also had an empty space we could use as a cocktail area or, more likely - a space for the kids to hang out in.</p><p>Overall, despite having some interesting personality and a lot of the features we are looking for, we're thinking this is most likely not where we'll be holding our reception. We did get a lot of cards and pamplets for recommendations for other vendors though, that was a definate perk of this visit. We're excited to continue looking at venues.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.237	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.237	3	0x00000000000007D8
100008	Hilton Garden Inn Dayton/Beavercreek	2013-06-10	Jen and James	<p>We visited the <a href="http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ohio/hilton-garden-inn-dayton-beavercreek-DAYBCGI/index.html" target="_blank">Hilton Garden Inn</a> yesterday and it has a very nice setup. We would get an entire ballroom (as opposed to half a ballroom like the Mandalay) to the side that would share a bathroom with the main restaurant, but would be otherwise on its own. The space also includes a spacious hall/lobby that would be included where the cocktail hour and buffet line would likely take place. The room and hotel in general are both very beautiful. We would probably need chair covers, but that seems to be common among the sites we've visited. The hotel also allows us to reserve a block of rooms for our guests to get a discounted rate, which is an added convenience the previous venues do not have.</p><p>Overall, it's fairly standard from what we've seen with ballrooms and would be a fair choice, though it is a bit pricy compared to our other contenders. We're still eager to see our remaining options.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.240	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.240	3	0x00000000000007D9
100009	Newport Aquarium	2013-06-11	Jen and James	<p>The visit to the <a href="http://www.newportaquarium.com/" target="_blank">Newport Aquarium</a> could not have gone better. Margaret walked us through where the key points in the reception would occur - the cocktail hour, the bars, the buffet, and lastly the reception space. It was all beautiful. While the aquarium itself was definitely wonderful, we were very pleasantly surprised with the reception space. The room had hints of the aquarium, but was very elegant and focused on the Cincinnati skyline that would look amazing as a backdrop to the head table. It was by far the nicest room we've seen so far.</p><p>There are 2 main drawbacks to the aquarium. The first is that it is an hour to an hour and a half from our ceremony location. The other is the price - everywhere else has the location and catering combined, so the location is free or close to it. With the aquarium, we would be purchasing them separately. The amazing location and available perks may be well worth it though....</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.247	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.247	3	0x00000000000007DA
100010	Presidential Banquet Center and Kohler Catering	2013-06-14	Jen and James	<p>The <a href="http://kohlercatering.net/" target="_blank">Presidential Banquet Center</a> was very nice. The rooms were themed after presidents and we had our choice of the Lincoln or Jefferson room, depending on how much space we would need. The Lincoln room was recently remodeled, though they both looked very nice. The nicest feature of the rooms was that they both had built in bars. All of the other venues we have seen have portable bars that seem a little out of place. The biggest disadvantage was that there were 4 rooms available, which means there could be up to 3 other events happening the same night as ours. And all 4 rooms share the main entries and bathrooms, which is a little inconvenient.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.253	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.253	3	0x00000000000007DB
100011	Beavercreek Golf Club	2013-06-15	Jen and James	<p>The grounds were beautiful at the <a href="http://www.beavercreekgolfclub.com/" target="_blank">Beavercreek Golf Club</a>. The reception room had a large picturesque window that would make a great backdrop for the head table and the rest of the room was very nice. It's probably the nicest of the venues, though the catering leaves a little to be desired as far as variety and our tastes. It's our favorite of the standard ballroom spaces though, as it's both unique and elegant, our two desires when it comes to a location. It's also conveniently located near several hotels and is less than half an hour from the ceremony location. It's definitely in the running for our favorite location.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.257	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.257	3	0x00000000000007DC
100012	Szynski/Schafer Wedding Status Update	2013-07-01	Jen and James	<p>It’s been a busy 2 weeks, but we’re ready to post our latest wedding news. We’ve chosen our reception venue – the Newport Aquarium. We wanted to wait until it was official, and we now have paper work saying we will have it there on our desired date. It was a really tough decision, we were especially torn between the Newport Aquarium and the Beavercreek Golf Club, but in the end, all of the bonuses and choices we get with the Newport outweigh the negatives of price and distance. We hope our guests agree that the distance is worth the unique experience of having an aquarium to ourselves for an evening.</p><p>We’re currently working on choosing a caterer for the food and another for the cake. We’re hoping to get tastings scheduled soon so we can get that decision taken care of. We’re also hoping to visit a few places in the Cincinatti area looking for a few hotel blocks for the wedding and attractions we can recommend if guests have any additional free time that weekend. We’re also looking forward to the next few weeks getting to spend time with our friends and family. 4th of July weekend, we are visiting with James’ family in Michigan and then going to our flower girl Sophie’s 2nd birthday. A week and a half later, we are spending a week with Jen’s sister and brother-in-law in San Diego for Comic Con. Jen’s sister will also be flying back with us and spending a week in Ohio – that should be a lot of fun.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.263	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.263	3	0x00000000000007DD
100013	Cake and Catering Tastings	2013-07-24	Jen and James	<p>Today was a very productive day for wedding planning. Our first stop was <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/affordableweddingcreations/" target="_blank">Affordable Wedding Creations</a>, where we tried 4 different cakes - white with strawberry, Bavarian, Chocolate, and carrot cake. They were all pretty good, though the chocolate was a bit too... Chocolate-y, as crazy as that sounds. We'd want a different filling if we had a chocolate layer. We all really liked the white and carrot cake though, and the cost was really reasonable. We'd also get a free anniversary cake on our 1 year anniversary, which is a nice bonus.</p><p>Next, we went to <a href="http://www.chefschoicecatering.com/" target="_blank">Chef's Choice</a> catering. Very impressive. We loved 75% of the food, and the rest was high quality, even if it wasn't our taste. Our favorite foods were the potato, meatball, and pot sticker appetizers and the sides. The entrees were good, but we'd want to make a few changes. They surprised us with macaroons for dessert that were incredible. They would make a great addition to the candy/dessert bar if we wanted to go that route. Definitely a strong contender for our  catering choice.</p><p>Next on the list was <a href="http://www.aspoonfullasugar.com/" target="_blank">A Spoon Fulla Sugar</a> for a cake tasting. We received a nice assortment of 6 cakes (white, strawberry, red velvet, carrot, hummingbird, and chocolate) as well as 10 or so fillings. Our favorite cakes were the white and hummingbird. The cream cheese, peanut butter, Oreo, and butter cream were our favorites for the fillings. All in all, it was pretty enjoyable and the cakes were delicious.</p><p>Next was <a href="http://www.funkysonline.com/" target="_blank">Funky's Catering</a>. Another very impressive caterer. We were asked a lot of specific details while sampling the food, which was intense as we haven't planned that far yet, but it was still an enjoyable experience. Again, the majority of the food was tasty and all of it was visually appealing. We weren't a fan of most of the cold hor d'oeuvres, but enjoyed the bbq meatballs, spinach and artichoke dip as well as a few others. None of the entrees blew us out of the water, but they were still very good. They definitely made our catering decision interesting.</p><p>Next, we went to <a href="http://www.fantasyinfrosting.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy In Frosting</a>. We were given 6 cakes - chocolate chip, raspberry swirl, red velvet, white, chocolate, and marble. We also got 7 fillings and 2 different icings to try. When we mentioned that Jen likes Lemon cake and we both like carrot, the woman we were working with stepped in back and returned with lemon and carrot cake. While we had trouble coming up with what we wanted for each layer at the other bakeries, we already know what we'd want for each layer here. We also saw a cake that we got some inspiration as far as the general look and feel for the cake. It was definitely a wonderful experience with delicious cakes.</p><p>Next was a visit to the <a href="http://www.newportaquarium.com/" target="_blank">Newport Aquarium</a> so that Jen's Mom and Sister could see the space. We are still convinced this is the perfect reception venue for us. We think we have them convinced it's the right place too.</p><p>Last, we visited <a href="http://bonbonerie.com/" target="_blank">BonBonerie</a>. We tried the Chocolate Raspberry Romance, Opera Cream, Almond Cream, Carrot Cake, and Lemon Romance. The carrot cake was the best we had so far, but the rest fell a little short of our expectations. The design options also felt a bit more limited. It was a good experience overall, but this is likely not our best option.</p><p>All in all, it was a fun experience and left us with a lot to think about.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.267	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.267	3	0x00000000000007DE
100014	Bridal Shower	2013-07-29	Jen	<p>Yesterday, my sister, mom and one of my bridesmaids Cheyenne threw me a bridal shower. While the date wasn't much of a surprise, the majority of what happened during it was. For snacks, we had fruit, crackers and veggies with dips as well as candy. A friend of my sister's also made cupcakes (thanks Abby!) for the event.</p><p>We played a couple rather interesting games. One game involved getting to know each other through passing around a stack of envelopes based on the instructions on the card, another quizzed guests on how well they knew me and James, another pitted guests against each other to see who knew the most about wedding history and cheesy candy puns (which me and Ally won!), another had guests competing against each other to make the best wedding makeup look (and they all looked pretty darn good!), and the last was wedding charades. Guests also wrote date ideas for James and I to try out, and keep in a cute wedding themed vase. We were also ‘showered’ with gifts and cards that I’m certain will make a wonderful impact on James and I starting our lives together.</p><p>I cannot express how much the event meant to me. While I can say not all of it turned out quite how I would have planned it, it was truly heartwarming to have my friends and family (and future family!) take the time to celebrate this stage of our lives with us. Both James and I appreciate the tremendous support we've been shown through this whole process and this party was a wonderful time for me to take a step back from wedding planning and enjoy the experience. Thank you everyone, especially my sister Ally, who made yesterday all that it was.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.273	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.273	3	0x00000000000007DF
100015	Two Decisions Down!	2013-08-23	Jen and James	<p>We've made two more major decisions with our wedding - the cake and the caterer. The cake was easy - <a href="http://www.fantasyinfrosting.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy in Frosting</a> won over our hearts and taste buds. Their cakes and fillings were all delicious, the people in the store were all kind and welcoming, and they had an impressive variety. We already have a pretty good idea of what flavors we want to pick too - The bottom tier will be chocolate chip with a cookies and cream filling, the next tier will be lemon with raspberry filling, the next tier will be carrot cake, and the top tier will be white cake with white filling. Sounds delicious, right? We've also got a good idea of what the cake will look like, but we don't want to give away all of the surprises.</p><p>We also officially made the decision on our caterer last night. We've been going back and forth between the two we had done a tasting at. Then, <a href="http://www.chefschoicecatering.com/" target="_blank">Chef's Choice</a> invited us to a promotional event and we decided to put off our decision between them and Funky's until then. We did our research before hand - the costs are pretty similar, both have good reviews, and they are two of the three caterers able to have receptions at the Newport, which is a good endorsement. At the tasting, the food was pretty much all wonderful. Most of the hors d'oeuvres they had available weren’t really our taste, but they were executed very well and we really enjoyed most of the other foods. We already liked the hors d'oeuvres at our original tasting anyways. In addition, the special promotion at the event was that anyone who signed a contract in the next 2 weeks would receive a free hors d'oeuvres for their wedding. That was definitely the selling point. We're happy to have that decision made and look forward to deciding which of the delicious foods we will have on our wedding day.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.277	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.277	3	0x00000000000007E0
100016	Another Major Hurdle Behind Us	2013-09-30	Jen and James	<p>We have reserved another vendor and could not be happier. We had specific requirements in mind and <a href="http://www.partypleasersservices.com/" target="_blank">Party Pleasers</a> is everything we wanted and more. They had a wonderful package deal that includes a DJ and more than enough lights for our event at a fair price. We are also able to customize the music for the ceremony as much as we want. We first saw them when we went to a bridal show with James' family in Cincinnati and put a deposit on our date with them this past Thursday at the Newport's bridal show. We're certain they will make an amazing addition to the vendors we already have lined up.</p><p>The Newport bridal show also gave us a lead on a photographer we both really liked are interested in pursuing as well as a possibility for a Hotel Block. Hopefully we'll have more good progress news for you soon.</p><p>We are also fortunate enough that a close family friend, who happens to be an amazing hair cutter and stylist, has the day available and will be able to do hair for the girls the morning of the wedding. Jen and the bridesmaids are guaranteed to look great with Mindy in charge.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.283	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.283	3	0x00000000000007E1
100017	Lots of News on the Wedding Front	2013-10-30	Jen and James	<p>The wedding is coming together piece by piece. Jen made the official decision on the bridesmaid dresses (with some help from James) and the girls have all ordered and received them. There was a little stress involved with ordering, but it worked out in the end. We're excited to see them all dressed up on our big day. Jen also picked out her wedding dress. It has already been ordered and sent to the store. Jen went in for her fitting and the dress is amazing. It's absolutely beautiful and fits like a glove. It's currently being altered to add a bustle and we should be picking it up soon. That's all you (and James) get to know of that subject until April 5th. We should be looking into the clothing for the guys soon.</p><p>In preparation for the wedding, James found a Groupon for dance lessons and we decided to give it a shot. We have nothing but good things to say about <a href="http://www.alwaysballroom.com/" target="_blank">Always Ballroom Dancing</a>. Our instructor was amazing to work with and we learned a lot in our 2 classes. Unfortunately our schedule and budget don't allow us to take more classes at this time, but we had a wonderful experience and are definitely keeping that in mind as an option in the future should our work schedule allow.</p><p>We've also booked two of our last vendors. The lead we had from the Newport show was a huge hit and we are happy to say we will be having <a href="http://atwp.biz/" target="_blank">A Thousand Words</a> as our photographer. We meshed with them really well at the show and their prices and packages were exactly what we were looking for. This weekend, we are excited to be getting a second set of engagement photos done with them. They give free engagement sessions for anyone who books a wedding with them (in addition to free future sessions). It will be interesting to see how this session differs from our first set. It sounds like we might be doing some outside shots if the weather permits, so that could be cool.</p><p>We have been throwing around the idea of a videographer for a while, but wanted to wait until we had a better idea of a budget. In the end, we agreed it was worth finding some way to make it work. We're really happy with the work we have seen from <a href="http://www.rohrigvideo.com/" target="_blank">Rohrig Video</a> and look forward to working with them. We were excited to see they have a <a href="http://youtu.be/IYko8r5ikew" target="_blank">wedding video</a> (Newport Aquarium starts at 13:10) where the couple had their reception at the Newport Aquarium and used the same photographer we are using. Seeing that made us even more confident this is the right choice for us. We're planning on getting an edited video as well as all of the raw footage, so we have another way to be able to enjoy the memory of our wedding for years to come.</p><p>Up next for wedding planning is finishing selecting the invitations, meeting with vendors, choosing tuxes for the guys, and choosing centerpieces. We're looking forward to continuing work on this amazing journey.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.303	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.303	3	0x00000000000007E2
100018	4 Months to Go!	2013-12-05	Jen and James	<p>We are two thirds of the way through our engagement and have the end in sight. All of our major vendors are chosen and we have made a lot of progress with meetings and plans with them. We're starting to get into more of the details, which is a welcomed change. We've chosen our invitation style and have decided on a timeline of events, so we should have invitations ordered soon and sent around the end of December. That is right where we wanted to be.</p><p>Jen's sister has kindly offered to look into something that was not on our radar quite yet and has helped us find and schedule a makeup artist for the day of the wedding. We will be having a consultation with her after the holidays, but are fairly certain she is a good match.</p><p>We've been looking for centerpiece ideas for the vast majority of our engagement and have made some major progress in that department as well. We're picking up half of our vases today thanks to Jen's sister finding a nearby person with bulk vases she no longer needs. We will order the other half online soon. We have a good idea what we would like to do with them and it's certainly a relief to have a plan for what has been a major stress.</p><p>With the holiday season upon us, we've moved some of our focus from our wedding to celebrating with friends and family. We were lucky enough to have three Thanksgiving events this year - one with close friends, one with James' brothers, and one with Jen's parents and family friends - and are certainly thankful for all of those who welcomed us into their home. For the Christmas holiday, we both have a week off of work, so we are looking forward to celebrating Jen's dad's birthday as well as Christmas with both of our families. It's certainly a wonderful time of year that we are enjoying to the fullest.</p><p>For December, our main wedding goals are finishing the invitations and centerpieces. If we can find the time, it would also be nice to make progress on the men's suits as well as more day of essentials. While our engagement has been an interesting journey, we are looking forward to when we can call each other husband and wife. It's exciting how soon that is.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.310	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.310	3	0x00000000000007E3
100019	Lots of Details!	2014-01-24	Jen and James	<p>The new year has been a crazy time for us, but we are certainly enjoying the last few months before starting our amazing journey as husband and wife. We received the invitations we ordered from <a href="http://www.weddingpaperdivas.com/">Wedding Paper Divas</a> and they were perfect. We had a small issue with ordering, but Wedding Paper Divas addressed our issue quickly and exceeded our expectations. We would happily recommend them to anyone in the market for wedding stationary of any type. At the beginning of the month, we sent out invitations and it has been an interesting experience getting a few back each day. It makes this whole experience that much more real seeing that people are making plans to attend.</p><p>We've officially chosen the tuxes for the guys, which is one less thing we need to worry about. Jen's sister Ally had a great experience with <a href="http://www.pricestores.com/">Prices</a> for her wedding and we are confident they will work out great for us as well. We were excited to see they have a color for the vests that is very similar to the color of the bridesmaid dress.</p><p>We've also crossed off some of our smaller (though still essential) items on our to-do list. We've chosen our song and well as James' song with his mom. Jen's dance with her dad is quickly getting narrowed down. We've also picked out a guestbook, flower girl basket, and started working on thank you gifts for the amazing people who have helped make this whole thing possible.</p><p>We've started work on our honeymoon. We're currently in the process of getting passports as our top honeymoon choice is a 4 day cruise to the Bahamas. It's been a slow process getting everything together, but we're optimistic we will get everything figured out. Neither of us have been on a cruise, so we're getting very excited at the prospect of going in a few short months.</p><p>We've made a lot of progress on the centerpieces. We know exactly how we want them to look, it's just a matter of acquiring the remaining items. We should be able to cross that item off our list very soon. We've also started working on wedding favors. It's really exciting working on the more detailed points of the wedding now that the vendors have all been booked.</p><p>We've been lucky in the help and support we've received from our family. Jen's mom used to be a professional florist and is helping us with the bouquets and boutonnieres. Jen worked with her on the flower choices and we're picking up a few of the remaining pieces before we can start work on getting those together. James' mom and one of her sisters, will be throwing Jen and Nicole, the other bride joining the Schafer family this summer, a joint bridal shower. In addition to many women from James' family, some or all of the bridesmaids as well as Jen's mom will be joining us that weekend, so it should be a fun experience. Jen is very excited to meet and visit with her future family and James is excited to get to spend some time with his brothers at his bachelor party. Jen's sister Ally has also been helping organize some of the events including a makeup trial day with our wedding makeup artist, a surprise bachelorette party, a pre wedding "girls" day, and figuring out when we can get into the church for decorating as well as the rehearsal dinner. We are so thankful for how kind and giving our families have been through this whole experience.</p><p>While a lot of our time has been dedicated to preparing for our wedding, we have also found time to spend with family and friends. We also have a few weekends planned that should hopefully be planning free as we get closer to this amazing day. We’re especially looking forward to a 3 day weekend in Florida with James’ parents. It’s also exciting to have Jen’s sister flying in from Honolulu in February and staying for the remaining 2 months before the wedding. I’m sure she will be a tremendous help, as she has already contributed so much to make our special day so wonderful.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.317	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.317	3	0x00000000000007E4
100020	Michigan Bridal Shower!	2014-02-10	Jen	<p>How does a girl get so lucky to end up with two amazing bridal showers? This past weekend James and I drove to Michigan to visit with family and celebrate our upcoming nuptials. Saturday was a fun day of visiting and spending time at a nearby casino. Sunday was the real highlight of the weekend though.</p><p>James' Mom Mary and Aunt Jan threw a wonderful bridal shower. I had the pleasure of sharing the event with Nicole, my amazing friend and bridesmaid who happens to also be marrying into the Schafer family this summer. We haven't known each other long, but she has shown to be a great person and I can't think of a nicer girl to share the spotlight with. I absolutely love how Mary and Jan made the room very much a mix of my and Nicole's themes. The room was decorated in blue and teal (for James and I) and two shades of purple (for Justin and Nicole). Everything represented both of us down to the blue punch in purple cups! It was amazing. The party started with wonderful food. There were mini sandwiches, fruits and veggies, chips and dip and a salad. I was a little leery of trying a salad with cashews in it (I'm normally very plain with ranch), but it ended up being my favorite of the things I ate. Definitely going to need to ask someone for a recipe! The desserts including cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and other treats that followed were also amazing!</p><p>After food, we played a word scramble game, a game determining old wives tales, and a game involving rolling dice for prizes (my favorite). To finish off the party, we were showered with so many kind gifts. I am truly honored by how supportive James' family has been of our upcoming wedding and feel so lucky to be becoming a part of this amazing family. I can't wait to put the various gifts to good use! I also appreciate my mom, sister, and good friend Lori making the 5 hour trip to spend the day celebrating with me. And a special thank you to Mary and Jan for throwing this amazing shower and making me feel like a member of the family. I cannot thank them enough.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.320	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.320	3	0x00000000000007E5
100021	Bachelorette Party!	2014-03-23	Jen	<p>I have to start out by saying "Thank you Ally!". My sister truly outdid herself with my bachelorette party. Were I to plan my own party, I can't think of anything I would have done differently. The evening started at the Funny Bone Comedy Club. I've been there a few times (one of the more recent times being the day after James and I got engaged!) and every time has been a wonderful experience. In addition to Ally, we were joined by my mom, Mary (James' mom), Cheyenne (Bridesmaid) and Lori (Bridesmaid), as well as my good friends Christy, Kristi and Mindy. The tables were festively decorated with assorted pink and wedding themed items. The girls showered me with plenty of fun gifts (I love all of the new PJs!). For the show, we enjoy 3 very talented comedians as well as appetizers and a few tasty drinks. As it was my bachelorette party and no one else there was admitting to celebrating anything, all 3 comedians made a point to pick us out of the crowd and jokingly wish me luck or joke about my impending nuptials. It was all in good fun and I had a great time.</p><p>After the show, we walked a short ways to Bar Louie, where we had a few more drinks, met some interesting strangers, and met up with my friend Miriaha. My favorite part of the evening was sitting around the fire pit outside of the bar with the girls talking, laughing, drinking, and enjoying each other’s company. It was certainly a fun way to put wedding stress aside and enjoy my "last night of freedom".</p><p>I would also like to say thank you to James' parents for joining us this weekend. It was so much fun getting to spend time with them both.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.327	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.327	3	0x00000000000007E6
100022	10 Days!	2014-03-26	Jen and James	<p>It's amazing how quickly 12 months has turned into just over a week. The end is most definitely in sight. We've been tying up a few loose ends, but for the most part, the wedding is planned. All of the meetings are done. All of the bills are paid. All of the pre wedding parties are behind us as fond memories. Now, all that's left is for us to flesh out a few details and enjoy these last few days of engagement before we say "I do".</p><p>One of our major excitements these last few months was getting the honeymoon planned. We had no idea what all was involved in booking a cruise, but are excited to see the results of our effort. We will be enjoying a 4 night cruise in the Bahamas. We have a lot of relaxing planned, as well as a tour of one of the islands. After all that has happened the last year, we are certainly looking forward to spending some time together without the pressing wedding deadline taking up the majority of our time.</p><p>That's certainly not to say that this has not been an enjoyable experience. We have had the wonderful experience of becoming closer as a couple, integrating more into each other’s families, and have many happy memories of our engagement. All of the stress, hard work, and long nights have certainly been worth it.</p><p>We would like to use this time to say a special thank you to our families. James' parents, brothers, and future sister-in-law have made many visits to us during this engagement, helped us along the way, and have helped make this experience so positive. Jen's parents have been an amazing support as well and Jen's mom taking on the bulk of the responsibility with the flowers has been a tremendous help. It's also been a huge help having Jen's sister Ally in town the last 1 1/2 months. We also can’t wait for Ally’s husband Tylor to get here from Hawaii in a few days. We are truly lucky to have our families show us so much love and support during this time in our lives.</p><p>And thank you to everyone else who has been there for us - as a friend, a helping hand, or a supporter. The last year would have been far different if we had not surrounded ourselves with such positive people.</p><p>We’ve updated the Guest Information section of this site to include Directions to the Ceremony, Reception and Hotels.  These links should open google maps where users can print a map or smart phone users can get turn by turn navigation.  We look forward to making a few more changes to the site after the wedding to include video and photos once we get them back from our vendors so be sure to check that out in the next few weeks.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.330	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.330	3	0x00000000000007E7
100023	WE'RE MARRIED!!!	2014-04-06	Jen and James	<p>So it's finally official.  We are married!  We want to thank everyone who attended the ceremony and reception yesterday.  We hope everyone had a wonderful time.  We also want to give extra thanks to all the family, friends and vendors that helped make yesterday spectacular.  We had a wonderful time and will never forget it.</p><p>We're off on our honeymoon in The Bahamas for a week.  We look forward to updating the site with wedding photos and videos when we return.</p>	2014-05-06 20:14:08.337	3	2014-05-06 20:14:08.337	3	0x00000000000007E8
101000	Wedding Wrap Up	2014-05-07	Jen and James	<p>We’ve been married for a month already! Since we got back from our honeymoon for 3 weeks ago, things are finally starting to return to normal.  Our 4 night cruise to the Bahamas was so phenomenal we started researching options for our next cruise as soon as we got home.  We both had a wonderful time and couldn’t have asked for a better honeymoon.</p><p>We haven’t gotten our pictures back from the photographer yet but we have a number of pictures from our big night already posted to Jen's Facebook account.  We hope to get our official pictures in the next few weeks and we’ll upload them to the same album.</p><p>Our videographer got our wedding video to us last week and we’ve already watched it twice.  We have a DVD at home that we’ll gladly show anyone who’d like to watch it with us but we also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f8ngro3GDI" target="_blank">shorter shareable  video</a> for everyone.</p><p>We’d like to once more thank everyone for making our wedding so special.</p>	2014-05-07 21:02:52.750	1	2014-05-07 21:02:52.750	1	0x00000000000007E9
