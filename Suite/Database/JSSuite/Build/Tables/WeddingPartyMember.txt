I had already been working there for over 2 years, the majority of it as an intern, when James joined the team I was working on. He quickly joined our group of coworkers that makes daily visits to the c-store, a convienience center in our building. We became friends, but wern't very close until we were both moved to a new team in a new area where we sat across from each other. We were put on a lot of the same projects and our daily interactions got us talking about our common interests. We soon started seeing each other outside of work at various social functions, the most frequent of which was Tuesday Night Trivia at a local bar. This was where we became the best of friends and quickly realized there was more.</p><span class="author">- Jen</span><h3>The Proposal</h3><p>I proposed to Jen while playing one of our favorite board games, Forbidden Island.  A few weeks prior to the proposal, I made my intentions known during Jen's mother's birthday party.  After that, Jen helped me pick out the rings and I planned a fun weekend for the two of us at the Newport Aquarium.</p><p class=\"bio\">I told Jen that I would propose at home when we got back from the trip but instead I planned a surprise proposal for the day before we left.  I took pictures of Jen's Engagement Ring and taped them to the playing cards inside Forbidden Island.  Then when we got home from work I fixed a delicious macaroni and cheese and hot dog dinner and then very nervously asked Jen if she wanted to play.  Right away she knew something was happening because of how nervous I was but once we started I was able to recompose and explain the altered rule set to her.  We played on the most difficult setting but through luck and fate were able to rescue the Engagement Ring from the sinking island on our first try!  I then got down on one knee and Jen said Yes!</p><span class="author">- James</span>	NULL	Rummy	Dayton, Ohio	NULL	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	0x000000000000ADEF

Currently, she is working in a private home as a caregiver for developmentally disabled women and also works as a team member for Beauty and Baskets, LLC, a family business owned by her future mother-in-law. She is working on applying to graduate school to become a Physician’s Assistant. In her free time, when she is not with Justin or at work, she enjoys reading, playing softball, hanging out with friends and crafting.</p><p>Justin and Nikki first met when Nikki transferred from St. Pat’s to Portland Public Schools in sixth grade. Two of the first people to school, Justin didn’t have anyone to play basketball with in the morning, so he would come hang out on the stairs to flirt with Nikki. Throughout both middle school and high school, they stayed friends but didn’t have many classes together. Despite not seeing each other much, Nikki managed to wear his football jersey a few times at school thanks to Allison Foreback asking him for her. After one of her long-term relationships ended, Ally would always hint to her that she should date Justin.

Even at that time, they had no idea they would someday fall in love and become husband and wife. By the time summer was over, they were best of friends. Unfortunately, Justin was stuck in the friend zone for quite a while. They hung out every weekend she came home from school. He taught her how to change her own car oil and butcher chickens. She taught him patience and that you can never give up on someone if you love them. The next summer, Justin put in a good word for Nikki at Meijer and soon they were carpooling to work together and working as co-stockers on third shift. It was a tough summer, but it was a rewarding summer. It was then that she realized that Justin was the most genuine, selfless, kind man she had ever met. She finally realized that being with him was the only thing that kept her grounded.</p><p>Almost three years later, a week after they both graduated from college, they went to Florida to see Justin’s parents and take a breather after a long, exhausting four years of school. Little did she know, it would be the best vacation of their lives. Justin took her to Turtle Mound, a national historic site on New Smyrna Beach, where they walked up a boardwalk, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of butterflies, to the top of the trees overlooking the beautiful water. Nicole is infatuated with the grace and beauty of butterflies and couldn’t help but stop every two seconds to take pictures of her breathtaking surroundings. Once they reached the top deck, she hopped up on the edge of the rail to get a better view and take it all in. Out of nowhere, a nervous, stumbling Justin pulled out a ring box, got down on one knee and started to profess his love to her. A crying Nikki, not hearing one thing he said and repeatedly asking if it was a joke, exclaimed “YES!” before he even asked the question.

I couldn’t ask for a better sister, confidant, protector, role model and partner in crime. Yes, we have our differences and yes, we have beat the living crap out of each other (me being the winner), but I wouldn’t change her for the world. She is a major part of who I have grown up to be. From the time I could talk, I wanted to be just like her. Her fun-loving, free-spirited attitude about life is aspiring and her confidence and prerogative to be herself no matter what other people say is something that always made me jealous. We are two very different personalities and it is hard to think sometimes that we came from the same parents. I think that is what makes us such a fabulous duo. I picked her as my maid of honor because I am lucky and my sister doubles as my best friend in the whole world, well best girlfriend anyway.

When we were together we were always laughing. We spent our nights after volleyball tournaments either eating “heart attack” pizza at Little Caesars’ or having deep conversations about life while eating ice cream on the deck of Frosty Boys. We were always up for fun and being crazy. I still know how to do some of the dance moves we made up and frequently showed them off at Wayside during college. Once Kelsey and I graduated, we were inseparable. Both a part of the BFC (A.K.A. The Bonfire Crew), we spent almost every night having way too much fun at bonfires. I practically lived at her house that summer, spending the night a few times a week. I never felt so young and free spirited.

My next-door neighbor for near all of my life, I consider Mary to be practically my sister. More than half of my childhood memories revolve around her, my sister and I. We grew up always competing to be the pink ranger when we pretended to be power rangers and Baby Spice when we pretended to be the Spice Girls. We always fought over who had the blondest hair and who could catch the most fireflies. The three of us enjoyed camping together, putting sand on our legs and shaving them with popsicle sticks in our turtle sandbox and feeding our imaginary pet mouse, “Mazey,” who lived in the electric box. When we went for walks with her dad, he’d warn us about trolls who lived in the sewer system. Looking back at it, I wonder if those trolls were all the boys he didn’t want us to date when we were older.  Luckily, us girls all managed to find our prince charming, leaving one or two trolls behind. Even though we fought a lot and she would team up with my sister to gang up on me, the youngest of the three, I have always looked up to her as my family and still do. She is still one of the only friends I have that tells me how it is and doesn’t regret it and I love her for that. To this day, I consider her not only a part of my family but a treasured friend that is always there to listen and give me tough love advice.</p>	Nicole	NULL	NULL	NULL	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	0x000000000000AE07
27	Tori	Beard	2	Bridesmaid	/Content/Images/Bridesmaid (w_Ben) - Tori Beard.JPG	3	5	NULL	<p>Tori Beard is currently finishing up her college career at Davenport in the nursing program. From DK on, I have always considered her my close friend, even when our lives have taken us our separate ways. Living down the street from her in elementary school we were always at each other’s house. I remember going shopping with her mom and dancing through the stores. I remember going to Grandma Sandy and Grandpa Butch’s house where we had corn wars, ran away from cows and climbed the “camels.” I remember her teaching me how to belly dance and having slumber parties with Preston and Billy Cherette. Tori, my sister and I even had our own rock band, namely, TNH and one time, Tori and I even drew up business plans for a dog walking and grooming business. Tori was and still is the friend I can be my crazy self around. Even when I wore pants past my belly button and wore shirts buttoned up to my chin, Tori went places in public with me without being embarrassed. She accepted me for who I was and I am so grateful for such a wonderful partner in crime.</p>	Nicole	NULL	NULL	NULL	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	0x000000000000AE08

She is a close friend to both Justin and myself. When we were deciding on our wedding party, I asked Justin which of his female friends he was closest to and Allison was his number one choice.</p><p>I fell in love with Allison first when we played volleyball and softball together freshman year of high school. We were both pitchers and Allison was the setter I could best hit off of, so we spent a lot of time together. What I love about Ally is her willingness to make time for her friends and that she was and still is always there to listen and make me feel better. In high school, during a really difficult time, Allison was there to pull me out of the rut I was in. She reminded me of what friendship is all about and was someone I could trust to be there when I needed her.</p><p>Even though we have quite opposite personalities, I think we compliment each other well. Her, being calm and a little more reserved helped me to settle down when I got worked up. She laughed at my outrageous jokes even if it wasn’t her kind of humor. She liked me even when I was a little embarrassing, and I love her for that. I am honored to have such a wonderful friend who is beautiful from the inside out.</p>	Nicole	NULL	NULL	NULL	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	2014-04-28 00:00:00.000	1	0x000000000000AE09
