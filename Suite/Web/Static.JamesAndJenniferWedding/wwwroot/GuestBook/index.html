                    <p>The wedding has come and gone! I had so much fun helping, as much as I could and I am truly grateful that you guys asked me to be apart of this journey!! What you didn&#39;t maybe even think about was the memories that you also gave me! I got to see my baby girl walk down the aisle, how many others are as fortunate to say this!! My little girl looked like a princess and I can never thank you enough for those precious memories!! Your reception was the best reception that I have yet to experience, a one in a lifetime type of thing! I hope you two are having a blast on your honeymoon!! I cant wait to see pictures and hear about your trip!! Much Love!!</p>
