                    <span>Newport, KY 41071</span>
                </h4>

                <p>We reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://www.comfortsuites.com/hotel-newport-kentucky-KY008" target="_blank">Comfort Suites</a> hotel which is just down the road from the Newport Aquarium.  It's a new hotel and very easy to get to.  They have rooms with double beds and also rooms with a single king.  The room rates range from $129.00 to $139.00.  To reserve a room please call 1-859-291-6700 and request a room under the Szynski-Schafer wedding block to get the discounted rate.</p>

                    <span>2 Garfield Place</span>

                </h4>

                <p>We have also reserved a block of rooms at <a href="http://www.garfieldsuiteshotel.com/" target="_blank">The Garfield Suites Hotel</a> in Cincinnati. This hotel is a little further from the reception but still only 10 minutes away. It is in the middle of downtown Cincinatti and it was slightly difficult to find the nearby parking garage. Expect a small parking fee if you stay in this hotel.  The Garfield used to be an apartment complex so it has a lot of 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom rooms for rent. The hotel is a great value for large families at $109.00 a night for a single bedroom and $139.00 a night for a 2 bedroom room. You can book a room by calling 1-800-367-2155 and requesting a suite under the Szynski-Schafer wedding block to get the discounted rate.</p>

                <h2>LOCAL ATTRACTIONS</h2>

                <p class="info">All of these attractions are less than an hour and a half from our home and are places we enjoy visiting and recommend you consider checking out if you have some extra time while with us during our wedding weekend or are visiting our area.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/" target="_blank">Air Force Museum</a> - Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton is home to the National Museum of the US Air Force, the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world. If you get a chance to visit, this is a really cool nearby location. Fun Fact - When James' family was visiting our home for the first time, this is where we chose to take them. Jen has also visited many times with her family.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.boonshoftmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Boonshoft Museum of Discovery</a> - This museum is geared towards educating children, though they often have fun events for all ages. Fun Fact - This is where we celebrated our first Valentine's day as a couple, looking up at the stars in the Space Theater. We've also attended a fundraising social event here that was a lot of fun.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.junglejims.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Jim's</a> - It's not often you see a grocery store listed in a collection of Local Attractions. But Jungle Jim's is no ordinary grocery store. This jungle themed 200K square foot building has a large variety of food and items from around the world.</p>

                <p><a href="http://youngsdairy.com/" target="_blank">Young's Jersey Dairy</a> - Young's has some of the best ice cream and cheese curds in the area. This 'farm' has miniature golf, a driving range, a petting zoo, and a restaurant. It's a nice family friendly location.</p>
