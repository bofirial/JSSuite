                <h3>How We Met</h3><p>We met on James' first day working at Reynolds and Reynolds, a company that primarily sells computer programs and forms for car dealerships. I had already been working there for over 2 years, the majority of it as an intern, when James joined the team I was working on. He quickly joined our group of coworkers that makes daily visits to the c-store, a convienience center in our building. We became friends, but wern't very close until we were both moved to a new team in a new area where we sat across from each other. We were put on a lot of the same projects and our daily interactions got us talking about our common interests. We soon started seeing each other outside of work at various social functions, the most frequent of which was Tuesday Night Trivia at a local bar. This was where we became the best of friends and quickly realized there was more.</p><span class="author">- Jen</span><h3>The Proposal</h3><p>I proposed to Jen while playing one of our favorite board games, Forbidden Island.  A few weeks prior to the proposal, I made my intentions known during Jen's mother's birthday party.  After that, Jen helped me pick out the rings and I planned a fun weekend for the two of us at the Newport Aquarium.</p><p class=\"bio\">I told Jen that I would propose at home when we got back from the trip but instead I planned a surprise proposal for the day before we left.  I took pictures of Jen's Engagement Ring and taped them to the playing cards inside Forbidden Island.  Then when we got home from work I fixed a delicious macaroni and cheese and hot dog dinner and then very nervously asked Jen if she wanted to play.  Right away she knew something was happening because of how nervous I was but once we started I was able to recompose and explain the altered rule set to her.  We played on the most difficult setting but through luck and fate were able to rescue the Engagement Ring from the sinking island on our first try!  I then got down on one knee and Jen said Yes!</p><span class="author">- James</span>
