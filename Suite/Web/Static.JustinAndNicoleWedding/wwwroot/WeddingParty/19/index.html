                <p>Justin graduated from Olivet College in May 2013 after playing football for four years. He received a Bachelor’s of Arts Degree in Insurance and Risk Management and is currently working as a claims adjuster at Auto-Owner’s Insurance in Lansing, Michigan. In his free time, when he is not with Nicole or at work, he enjoys fixing his truck, reading, volunteering as a football coach and hanging out with friends.</p><p>Nicole graduated Magna Cum Laude from Central Michigan University in May 2013, receiving her Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Biomedical Sciences. Currently, she is working in a private home as a caregiver for developmentally disabled women and also works as a team member for Beauty and Baskets, LLC, a family business owned by her future mother-in-law. She is working on applying to graduate school to become a Physician’s Assistant. In her free time, when she is not with Justin or at work, she enjoys reading, playing softball, hanging out with friends and crafting.</p><p>Justin and Nikki first met when Nikki transferred from St. Pat’s to Portland Public Schools in sixth grade. Two of the first people to school, Justin didn’t have anyone to play basketball with in the morning, so he would come hang out on the stairs to flirt with Nikki. Throughout both middle school and high school, they stayed friends but didn’t have many classes together. Despite not seeing each other much, Nikki managed to wear his football jersey a few times at school thanks to Allison Foreback asking him for her. After one of her long-term relationships ended, Ally would always hint to her that she should date Justin. Although Nikki didn’t get the hint (or didn’t take it seriously, anyway), a couple years later, she finally realized just how good of a suggestion Ally made.</p><p>The summer after graduating from high school, Nikki and Justin hung out with the same crowd. They (Justin, Ben, Jake, Blake, Kelsey and Nikki) called themselves The Bonfire Crew. Almost everyday of the summer they stayed up until 3 in the morning enjoying each others’ company and staying warm around a bonfire. Even at that time, they had no idea they would someday fall in love and become husband and wife. By the time summer was over, they were best of friends. Unfortunately, Justin was stuck in the friend zone for quite a while. They hung out every weekend she came home from school. He taught her how to change her own car oil and butcher chickens. She taught him patience and that you can never give up on someone if you love them. The next summer, Justin put in a good word for Nikki at Meijer and soon they were carpooling to work together and working as co-stockers on third shift. It was a tough summer, but it was a rewarding summer. It was then that she realized that Justin was the most genuine, selfless, kind man she had ever met. She finally realized that being with him was the only thing that kept her grounded.</p><p>Almost three years later, a week after they both graduated from college, they went to Florida to see Justin’s parents and take a breather after a long, exhausting four years of school. Little did she know, it would be the best vacation of their lives. Justin took her to Turtle Mound, a national historic site on New Smyrna Beach, where they walked up a boardwalk, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of butterflies, to the top of the trees overlooking the beautiful water. Nicole is infatuated with the grace and beauty of butterflies and couldn’t help but stop every two seconds to take pictures of her breathtaking surroundings. Once they reached the top deck, she hopped up on the edge of the rail to get a better view and take it all in. Out of nowhere, a nervous, stumbling Justin pulled out a ring box, got down on one knee and started to profess his love to her. A crying Nikki, not hearing one thing he said and repeatedly asking if it was a joke, exclaimed “YES!” before he even asked the question. It was the proposal of her dreams and she wouldn’t have changed a thing.</p>
