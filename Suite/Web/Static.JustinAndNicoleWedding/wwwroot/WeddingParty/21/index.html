                <p>Heather Simon, my beloved Maid of Honor, is a barber at Jude’s Barber Shop in Kentwood, Michigan. I couldn’t ask for a better sister, confidant, protector, role model and partner in crime. Yes, we have our differences and yes, we have beat the living crap out of each other (me being the winner), but I wouldn’t change her for the world. She is a major part of who I have grown up to be. From the time I could talk, I wanted to be just like her. Her fun-loving, free-spirited attitude about life is aspiring and her confidence and prerogative to be herself no matter what other people say is something that always made me jealous. We are two very different personalities and it is hard to think sometimes that we came from the same parents. I think that is what makes us such a fabulous duo. I picked her as my maid of honor because I am lucky and my sister doubles as my best friend in the whole world, well best girlfriend anyway. I know she will always be a part of my life whether I like it or not….hahaha!</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
