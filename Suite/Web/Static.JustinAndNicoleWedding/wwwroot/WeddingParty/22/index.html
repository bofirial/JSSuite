                <p>Jake and I met in elementary school. In middle school, we become closer friends to the point that I would spend weekends at his house. While at his house, Ben, Jake, and I would either be working on a project, riding the gator around little egypt or playing video games in his basement. After high school, we both attended Olivet College and majored in Insurance and Risk Management. Jake and I worked several jobs together during college. After he graduated last May, Jake obtained a job at Hastings Mutual Insurance Company.</p>            <span class="author">- Justin</span>
