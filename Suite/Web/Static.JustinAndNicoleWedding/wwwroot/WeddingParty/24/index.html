                <p>Elizabeth Moore, A.K.A. Lizzy Mcguire, A.K.A. Henry Stiles’ future wife, is finishing up her last year in Central Michigan University’s Education program, majoring in Biology, Secondary Education. I never thought I would find one of my best friends across the “street” in Barnes Hall my freshman year of college.</p><p>Going into college I was recovering from mono and much too tired to try to make friends. Luckily, my roomy Kyra was easy to make friends for me. Kyra, my only friend the first few months of college introduced me to Lizzy and Lizzy’s partner in crime, Erica, duly named “Lerica.” We all hit it off right away thanks to our unique sense of humor and partiality to eating Robinson food rather than making food ourselves…hahaha.</p><p>Lizzy and I, in particular had a lot in common and at that time I had no idea I would love her enough to live with her the next three years. Even through my most difficult times, Lizzy was there to push me through and give me the confidence to be myself. I am very lucky to have Lizzy, a one in a million friend who loves me for who I am and always listens when I need just that.</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
