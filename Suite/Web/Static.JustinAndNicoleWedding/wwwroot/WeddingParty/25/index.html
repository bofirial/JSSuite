                <p>Kelsey Graham, A.K.A. Jacque De Flips, as she is listed in my contacts, is finishing up her college career at Lansing Community College where she has studied architecture, real estate and business. In high school, Kelsey and I were volleyball teammates and did not start really getting to know each other until senior year of high school when we created the one of a kind volleyball friend trio, DSG, with our fellow junior friend, Chelsea Platte. When we were together we were always laughing. We spent our nights after volleyball tournaments either eating “heart attack” pizza at Little Caesars’ or having deep conversations about life while eating ice cream on the deck of Frosty Boys. We were always up for fun and being crazy. I still know how to do some of the dance moves we made up and frequently showed them off at Wayside during college. Once Kelsey and I graduated, we were inseparable. Both a part of the BFC (A.K.A. The Bonfire Crew), we spent almost every night having way too much fun at bonfires. I practically lived at her house that summer, spending the night a few times a week. I never felt so young and free spirited. We have gone through a lot since then and even now that we have grown up responsibilities we still manage to go out and have fun once in a while.</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
