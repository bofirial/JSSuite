                <p>Mary Alice Betts is the wonderful mother of Alex Betts, the ring bearer. My next-door neighbor for near all of my life, I consider Mary to be practically my sister. More than half of my childhood memories revolve around her, my sister and I. We grew up always competing to be the pink ranger when we pretended to be power rangers and Baby Spice when we pretended to be the Spice Girls. We always fought over who had the blondest hair and who could catch the most fireflies. The three of us enjoyed camping together, putting sand on our legs and shaving them with popsicle sticks in our turtle sandbox and feeding our imaginary pet mouse, “Mazey,” who lived in the electric box. When we went for walks with her dad, he’d warn us about trolls who lived in the sewer system. Looking back at it, I wonder if those trolls were all the boys he didn’t want us to date when we were older.  Luckily, us girls all managed to find our prince charming, leaving one or two trolls behind. Even though we fought a lot and she would team up with my sister to gang up on me, the youngest of the three, I have always looked up to her as my family and still do. She is still one of the only friends I have that tells me how it is and doesn’t regret it and I love her for that. To this day, I consider her not only a part of my family but a treasured friend that is always there to listen and give me tough love advice.</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
