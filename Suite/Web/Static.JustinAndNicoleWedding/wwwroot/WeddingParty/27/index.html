                <p>Tori Beard is currently finishing up her college career at Davenport in the nursing program. From DK on, I have always considered her my close friend, even when our lives have taken us our separate ways. Living down the street from her in elementary school we were always at each other’s house. I remember going shopping with her mom and dancing through the stores. I remember going to Grandma Sandy and Grandpa Butch’s house where we had corn wars, ran away from cows and climbed the “camels.” I remember her teaching me how to belly dance and having slumber parties with Preston and Billy Cherette. Tori, my sister and I even had our own rock band, namely, TNH and one time, Tori and I even drew up business plans for a dog walking and grooming business. Tori was and still is the friend I can be my crazy self around. Even when I wore pants past my belly button and wore shirts buttoned up to my chin, Tori went places in public with me without being embarrassed. She accepted me for who I was and I am so grateful for such a wonderful partner in crime.</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
