                <p>Allison Foreback is currently finishing up her college career at Davenport University in the nursing program. She is a close friend to both Justin and myself. When we were deciding on our wedding party, I asked Justin which of his female friends he was closest to and Allison was his number one choice.</p><p>I fell in love with Allison first when we played volleyball and softball together freshman year of high school. We were both pitchers and Allison was the setter I could best hit off of, so we spent a lot of time together. What I love about Ally is her willingness to make time for her friends and that she was and still is always there to listen and make me feel better. In high school, during a really difficult time, Allison was there to pull me out of the rut I was in. She reminded me of what friendship is all about and was someone I could trust to be there when I needed her.</p><p>Even though we have quite opposite personalities, I think we compliment each other well. Her, being calm and a little more reserved helped me to settle down when I got worked up. She laughed at my outrageous jokes even if it wasn’t her kind of humor. She liked me even when I was a little embarrassing, and I love her for that. I am honored to have such a wonderful friend who is beautiful from the inside out.</p>            <span class="author">- Nicole</span>
