                <p>In second grade, Jarred and I were in the same class. Throughout that school year we got to know each other and I learned he had a twin. During the spring and summer, I would ride my bike down to Matt and Jarreds house to go down to Old School Mannor and play basketball. These trips would always result in some kind of fight. As time went by, we continued to play football, basketball and track together. Jarred has recently graduated from Olivet College and is working at General Motors Delta Plant. Matt is currently finishing up his degree while working at General Motors.</p>            <span class="author">- Justin</span>
