                <p>Father Mathias graduated from Fowler High School in 2001 and attended Grand Valley State University to study Engineering and Mathematics Education. After a spiritual calling to the priesthood and realizing that dedicating his life to God was the only way for him to be fulfilled, he transferred to Saint John Vianney Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. After graduating in 2006, he went to Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit to study theology and on June 11, 2010, he was ordained a priest of Jesus Christ for the Diocese of Lansing. The first three years of the priesthood, he spent as an Associate Pastor of Queen of the Miraculous Medal Church in Jackson, MI and was the Sacramental Minister of Our Lady of Fatima in the Michigan Center. He has now been the pastor of Saint Mary’s Catholic Church of Westphalia for about seven months as of January 2014. In July of 2014, he will transfer to Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, MI to pursue a post-graduate degree in theology and serve on faculty.</p><p>Father Mathias is actually Justin’s second cousin. We are ecstatic that he will be marrying us, but are sad that he will be leaving soon after. Since joining St. Mary’s Parish, we have been blessed to have him as our pastor. His sermons are incredibly reflective and thoughtful and his passion makes you want to hear more and more. His youthful energy is contagious and he inspires change for the good. We get excited to go to church on Sundays and have both found a renewed sense of faith because of him.</p>
