                <p>My parents have been patiently waiting a long time for their boys to get married. They are both the youngest of their families and have gone to countless weddings for their nieces and nephews. I'm pleased that they finally get to attend a wedding for one of their sons and to have a daughter join our family. They have been the best parents any son could ask for and I've learned so much from them. I am so happy that they will be able to celebrate with us on our wedding day!</p>            <span class="author">- Justin</span>
